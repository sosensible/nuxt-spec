appwrite auth - we want to connect to appwrite to pull users for this page. http://localhost:3000/admin/users , we want the appwrite data to be the source of truth, not the current columns on the page. We do want to add edit and delete fuctionality, preferably with a popup editor for the user. Here is some context for appwrite, but use the MCP also.

Yes—Appwrite has a well-defined **user role concept** that supports both **role-based access control (RBAC)** and **team-scoped permissions**, giving you granular control over who can do what across your app and backend.

### 🧑‍💼 Appwrite Role Concepts

#### **1. Platform Roles (Console-Level)**
These are used within the Appwrite Console to manage access for organization members:
- **Owner** – Full control, including billing and team management
- **Developer** – Full access to development resources, but no billing/team writes
- **Editor** – Can modify content but not infrastructure
- **Analyst** – Read-only access
- **Billing** – Access only to billing scopes
- **Custom Roles** – Coming soon for Scale and Enterprise plans

These roles govern what collaborators can do inside the Appwrite Console—not your app users.

#### **2. Auth Roles (App-Level)**
These are used in your app’s permission system:
- ole:guest – Unauthenticated users
- ole:member – Any authenticated user
- ole:user:<USER_ID> – Specific user
- ole:team:<TEAM_ID> – All team members
- ole:team:<TEAM_ID>/<ROLE> – Specific role within a team

You use these in permission arrays for documents, buckets, functions, etc.

---

#### **3. Custom Roles via Teams**
You can define custom roles within a team and assign permissions to them:
`js
sdk.teams.createRole('teamId', 'admin');
sdk.teams.updateRolePermissions('teamId', 'roleId', ['read( documents)', 'write(documents)']);
`
Then assign users to those roles for scoped access control.

---

### 🧩 Summary
Appwrite’s role system is modular:
- Console roles = admin panel access
- Auth roles = app-level permissions
- Team roles = scoped collaboration

If you're codifying this into SpecKit or onboarding flows, I can help scaffold role templates, permission maps, and runtime injection strategies for secure, maintainable access control. Just say the word.
