# Feature Specification: Basic Usability Enhancements - Dark Mode & Cross-Section Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `002-basic-usability-i`
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "basic usability - I want to add darkmode, and the front and backend should have a way to link to each other without manually passing it in the URL."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Dark Mode Toggle (Priority: P1)

A user working on the site across different times of day or in different lighting conditions needs to switch between light and dark themes to reduce eye strain and improve readability.

**Why this priority**: Dark mode is a fundamental accessibility and usability feature that directly impacts user comfort and reduces eye fatigue, especially during extended usage sessions. It's become a standard expectation in modern web applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling the theme switcher on any page and verifying that the entire interface (frontend and admin sections) adapts to the selected theme, with the preference persisted across browser sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the site for the first time, **When** they view any page, **Then** the system displays the theme matching their system preference (light/dark)
2. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they click the theme toggle button, **Then** the entire interface switches to the opposite theme immediately without page reload
3. **Given** a user has selected a theme preference, **When** they close and reopen their browser, **Then** their theme preference is preserved
4. **Given** a user switches between frontend and admin sections, **When** they navigate, **Then** the selected theme persists across both sections
5. **Given** a user is viewing the site in dark mode, **When** they view all components and pages, **Then** all text has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 ratio minimum) and all UI elements are clearly visible

---

### User Story 2 - Cross-Section Navigation (Priority: P2)

Users who need to access both frontend and admin sections want convenient navigation links between the sections without manually typing URLs, improving workflow efficiency.

**Why this priority**: This is an important usability enhancement that reduces friction for users who work across both sections, but it's secondary to the dark mode feature which affects all users constantly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking navigation links that take users from frontend to admin and vice versa, verifying the links appear in appropriate contexts and work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the frontend homepage, **When** they view the header or user menu, **Then** they see a link/button to access the admin section
2. **Given** a user is in the admin section, **When** they view the admin header, **Then** they see a link/button to return to the frontend
3. **Given** a user clicks the "Go to Admin" link from frontend, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** they land on the admin dashboard with the admin layout applied
4. **Given** a user clicks the "View Site" link from admin, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** they land on the frontend homepage with the frontend layout applied
5. **Given** a user navigates between sections, **When** they use these navigation links, **Then** their theme preference (light/dark) is maintained

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's browser doesn't support their system theme preference detection?
- How does the system handle theme switching during an in-progress API call or form submission?
- What happens if a user has disabled localStorage (theme preference storage)?
- How does the system handle navigation links for users without admin permissions?
- What happens when a user rapidly toggles the theme multiple times?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and apply the user's system theme preference (light/dark) on first visit
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a visible theme toggle control accessible from all pages in both frontend and admin sections
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist the user's theme preference across browser sessions using local storage
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply theme changes immediately to all visible components without requiring page reload
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain theme consistency across frontend and admin sections when users navigate between them
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide navigation links from frontend to admin section
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide navigation links from admin to frontend section
- **FR-008**: Navigation links to admin section MUST be contextually appropriate (e.g., in user menu, footer, or header)
- **FR-009**: Navigation links from admin MUST be clearly labeled and accessible from the admin header or sidebar
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle theme preference gracefully when localStorage is unavailable (fallback to system preference)

### Nuxt-Specific Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Theme state MUST be managed through a Pinia store accessed via composable pattern
- **NFR-002**: Theme preference MUST be hydrated on SSR to prevent flash of wrong theme
- **NFR-003**: Theme toggle component MUST work in both SSR and CSR contexts
- **NFR-004**: Navigation links MUST use Nuxt's router for client-side navigation (no full page reloads)
- **NFR-005**: Theme styles MUST use Tailwind's `dark:` variant system for consistency
- **NFR-006**: Performance MUST remain within budget: theme switching <50ms, navigation <500ms
- **NFR-007**: Theme toggle control MUST use Nuxt UI v4 components for consistency with the application's UI framework

### Key Entities

- **Theme Preference**: User's selected theme mode (light, dark, or system), persisted in localStorage with fallback to system preference
- **Theme State**: Current active theme (light or dark) computed from user preference and system setting
- **Navigation Context**: Current section (frontend or admin) used to determine appropriate cross-section navigation links

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

- [ ] API Routes: kebab-case.[method].ts
- [ ] Boolean variables: isX, hasX, canX, shouldX

## Assumptions _(if applicable)_

1. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+) support:
   - CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for theme implementation
   - `prefers-color-scheme` media query for system theme detection
   - localStorage API for theme preference persistence

2. **User Permissions**: Admin navigation links will be visible to all users in the frontend header/menu, but the admin section itself will handle authorization checks independently (outside scope of this feature)

3. **Existing Components**: All existing components (AppHeader, AppFooter, AdminHeader, AdminSidebar, etc.) support or can be easily adapted to support dark mode theming using Tailwind's `dark:` variants

4. **Layout Structure**: Current layout system (`default.vue` and `admin.vue`) provides appropriate locations for theme toggle controls and cross-section navigation links

5. **localStorage Availability**: Most users have localStorage enabled; when unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to system theme preference without persisting user choices

6. **Admin Access Patterns**: Admin users regularly switch between viewing the frontend site and managing content in the admin section, making cross-section navigation a valuable workflow improvement

7. **No Authentication State Required**: Cross-section navigation links don't need to check authentication state (admin routes will handle auth checks themselves)

8. **Client-Side Navigation**: Nuxt's client-side routing is available for smooth navigation between frontend and admin sections without full page reloads

9. **No API Dependencies**: Theme preference is entirely client-side; no server-side API calls required for theme management

10. **Color Palette**: Existing Tailwind configuration includes or will be updated to include appropriate color schemes that meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements in both light and dark modes
