# Tasks: Basic Usability Enhancements - Dark Mode & Cross-Section Navigation

**Branch**: `002-basic-usability-i`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-basic-usability-i/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/components.md, quickstart.md

**TDD Approach**: Following Constitution Principle IV - Tests written BEFORE implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

### Path Conventions

- **Nuxt Application**: `app/components/`, `app/composables/`, `app/stores/`, `app/plugins/`
- **Components**: `.vue` files in `app/components/` with TypeScript `<script setup lang="ts">`
- **Tests**: Unit tests in `tests/functional/`, E2E in `tests/e2e/`
- **Types**: Shared types in `types/` directory

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and type definitions

- [x] T001 Create TypeScript type definitions in `types/theme.ts` for ThemeMode, ActiveTheme, ThemeState
- [x] T002 [P] Verify Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` has `darkMode: 'class'` setting
- [x] T003 [P] Add CSS transition styles to `app/assets/css/main.css` for smooth theme changes (200ms)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - type system established ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core theme infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Create Pinia theme store in `app/stores/theme.ts` with state structure (mode, current, isTransitioning)
- [x] T005 Create useTheme composable wrapper in `app/composables/useTheme.ts` for store access
- [x] T006 Create theme initialization plugin in `app/plugins/theme-init.client.ts` with enforce: 'pre'
- [x] T007 [P] Extend useNavigation composable in `app/composables/useNavigation.ts` with crossSection computed property

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - theme state management and navigation context available ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Dark Mode Toggle (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately

   - Creates type definitions and configuration
   - Enables TypeScript autocomplete for theme types

2. **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS both user stories

   - Creates core theme infrastructure (store, composable, plugin)
   - Extends navigation composable
   - MUST be complete before US1 or US2 can begin

3. **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Can start after Foundational completion

   - No dependencies on User Story 2
   - Independently testable
   - MVP-ready once complete

4. **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Can start after Foundational completion

   - No dependencies on User Story 1 (though theme persists across navigation)
   - Independently testable
   - Can be developed in parallel with US1 if team capacity allows

5. **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on completion of both US1 and US2
   - Final verification and cleanup
   - TDD compliance check
   - Standards compliance review

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Dark Mode)**: Independent - can be completed and tested without US2
- **US2 (Cross-Section Navigation)**: Independent - can be completed and tested without US1
- **Integration**: US2 tests verify theme persists across navigation (integration with US1), but US2 is functional even without dark mode

### Within Each User Story

**TDD Cycle Order (MANDATORY)**:

1. **RED Phase**: Write ALL tests first, verify they FAIL
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code while keeping tests GREEN

**Implementation Order within GREEN Phase**:

1. Store/composable logic first (data layer)
2. Components second (presentation layer)
3. Integration third (wiring components together)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:

- T002 (Tailwind config) and T003 (CSS transitions) can run in parallel with T001 (types)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- T007 (useNavigation extension) can run in parallel with T004-T006 (theme infrastructure)

**RED Phase for US1**:

- T008 (store tests), T009 (composable tests), T010 (component tests), T011 (E2E tests) can all be written in parallel

**GREEN Phase for US1**:

- T017 (AppHeader) and T018 (AdminHeader) can run in parallel after T016 (ThemeToggle) is complete

**RED Phase for US2**:

- T028 (navigation tests), T029 (AppHeader tests), T030 (AdminHeader tests), T031 (E2E tests) can all be written in parallel

**GREEN Phase for US2**:

- T033 (AppHeader), T034 (AdminHeader), T035 (AdminSidebar) can all run in parallel after T032 (useNavigation) is complete

**Phase 5 (Polish)**:

- Most tasks marked [P] (T045, T046, T048, T049, T050) can run in parallel

### Parallel Team Strategy

**Single Developer**: Sequential priority order

1. Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 (MVP) ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí Polish

**Two Developers**:

1. Both: Setup + Foundational together
2. Dev A: US1 (Dark Mode) - RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
3. Dev B: US2 (Cross-Section Navigation) - RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR
4. Both: Polish + Final TDD Verification together

**Note**: US1 and US2 can be developed completely in parallel after Foundational phase completes

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 RED Phase

```bash
# Launch all test writing for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write theme store tests in tests/functional/stores/theme.test.ts"
Task: "Write useTheme tests in tests/functional/composables/useTheme.test.ts"
Task: "Write ThemeToggle tests in tests/functional/components/ThemeToggle.test.ts"
Task: "Write E2E theme tests in tests/e2e/theme.spec.ts"

# Then run all tests together and verify they ALL FAIL
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - Recommended

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T007) - CRITICAL
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T008-T027) - Full TDD cycle
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Theme toggle works on all pages
   - System preference detected
   - Theme persists across sessions
   - No FOUC on page load
   - Performance targets met
   - Accessibility verified
5. **DEMO/DEPLOY**: Dark mode is a complete, valuable feature
6. Optionally add US2 later as enhancement

### Incremental Delivery (Both Stories)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T007)

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Available)

**After Foundational Phase (T007) Completes**:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T008-T027)

  - RED: Write all tests (T008-T011)
  - GREEN: Implement (T012-T019)
  - REFACTOR: Optimize (T020-T022)
  - VERIFY: Standards (T023-T027)

- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T028-T044)

  - RED: Write all tests (T028-T031)
  - GREEN: Implement (T032-T036)
  - REFACTOR: Optimize (T037-T039)
  - VERIFY: Standards (T040-T044)

- **Both Together**: Polish (T045-T068)

**Timeline**: Parallel development can reduce time by ~40%

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 68 tasks across 5 phases

**Task Distribution**:

- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 4 tasks (BLOCKING)
- Phase 3 (US1 - Dark Mode): 20 tasks
  - RED: 4 tasks (T008-T011)
  - GREEN: 8 tasks (T012-T019)
  - REFACTOR: 3 tasks (T020-T022)
  - Standards: 5 tasks (T023-T027)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Navigation): 17 tasks
  - RED: 4 tasks (T028-T031)
  - GREEN: 5 tasks (T032-T036)
  - REFACTOR: 3 tasks (T037-T039)
  - Standards: 5 tasks (T040-T044)
- Phase 5 (Polish): 24 tasks (T045-T068)
  - General: 10 tasks (T045-T054)
  - TDD Verification: 6 tasks (T055-T060)
  - Standards Review: 8 tasks (T061-T068)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 15+ tasks can run in parallel across different phases

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- US1: Toggle theme on any page, verify persistence and no FOUC
- US2: Click cross-section links, verify navigation and theme persistence

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 27 tasks

- Delivers complete dark mode feature
- All TDD requirements met
- All standards verified
- Independently valuable to users

**Time Estimate** (single developer):

- MVP (US1 only): ~2-3 days
- Full feature (US1 + US2): ~3-4 days
- With parallel team: ~2 days for full feature

## Notes

- **[P]** = Tasks with different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story]** = Links task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD MANDATORY**: All RED phase tasks MUST verify tests FAIL before moving to GREEN phase
- **Constitution Compliance**: This task list enforces Principle IV (Test-Driven Development)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- MVP recommendation: Stop after US1, validate, deploy, then add US2 as enhancement
- Avoid: Starting GREEN phase before RED phase complete, skipping REFACTOR phase, batch test failures
- Commit strategy: Commit after RED phase (failing tests), after GREEN phase (passing tests), after REFACTOR phase (clean code)
- Review checkpoints at end of each phase before proceeding
