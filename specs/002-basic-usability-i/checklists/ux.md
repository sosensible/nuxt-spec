**Categories**: 10 (Visual Design, Interaction Design, Accessibility, Responsive, Performance, Dark Mode, Consistency, Coverage, Traceability, Clarity)  
**Traceability**: 60% of items include spec/contract references, 40% identify gaps  
**Focus Areas**:

- Visual & interaction design requirements (14 items)
- Accessibility requirements quality (12 items)
- Responsive design coverage (7 items)
- Dark mode specific requirements (7 items)
- Requirement clarity for UX terms (9 items)
- Consistency across patterns (7 items)
- User journey coverage (10 items)
- Performance & perceived speed (6 items)
- Traceability (6 items)
- Additional gaps identified (7 items)

**Key Findings**:

- ✅ Core functional requirements are well-defined
- ⚠️ Visual design specifics need more detail (colors, sizing, spacing)
- ⚠️ Mobile/responsive requirements have gaps
- ⚠️ Accessibility has some gaps (reduced motion, screen reader announcements)
- ⚠️ Visual feedback and loading states underspecified

**Severity Assessment**:

- **Critical Gaps** (blocking): None - feature is implementable
- **Important Gaps** (should address): Mobile UX, accessibility enhancements
- **Nice-to-Have** (future): Design system integration, advanced animations

**Usage Instructions**:

1. Review this checklist for UX-specific requirement quality
2. Prioritize addressing critical and important gaps
3. Document design decisions for identified gaps
4. Update spec.md or create UX design document
5. Re-validate after addressing gaps
6. Use alongside requirements.md checklist for complete validation

**Next Steps**:

- Decide which gaps to address before implementation
- Create UX design document for visual specifications (optional)
- Document mobile/responsive requirements explicitly
- Enhance accessibility requirements (reduced motion, screen readers)
- Proceed to implementation with TDD approach
