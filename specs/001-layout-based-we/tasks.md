# Tasks: Dual Layout System with Admin and Frontend Sections

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-layout-based-we/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the feature specification - focused on layout implementation and validation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

### Path Conventions

- **Nuxt Application**: `app/components/`, `app/pages/`, `app/layouts/`, `app/stores/`, `app/composables/`
- **Components**: `.vue` files in `app/components/` with TypeScript `<script setup lang="ts">`
- **Layouts**: `.vue` files in `app/layouts/` for layout components
- **Types**: Shared types in `types/` directory for layout system definitions
- **Styles**: CSS files in `app/assets/css/` for design system and layout-specific styles

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Install and configure Nuxt 4 with TypeScript strict mode and required dependencies (@nuxt/ui v4, Pinia, Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure Nuxt UI theme and Tailwind CSS in `nuxt.config.ts` with responsive breakpoints
- [ ] T003 [P] Setup Pinia state management configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`
- [ ] T004 [P] Create base CSS structure in `app/assets/css/main.css` with design system foundation
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure TypeScript strict mode and ESLint rules for Nuxt 4 project
- [ ] T006 [P] Configure @nuxt/image and @nuxt/scripts modules in `nuxt.config.ts` for optimized asset handling

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Create shared TypeScript type definitions in `types/layout.ts` for layout system contracts
- [ ] T008 [P] Create admin-specific TypeScript type definitions in `types/admin.ts` for admin layout features
- [ ] T009 Create layout Pinia store in `app/stores/layout.ts` for sidebar state and layout context management
- [ ] T010 Create navigation Pinia store in `app/stores/navigation.ts` for navigation state and route tracking
- [ ] T011 [P] Create useLayoutState composable in `app/composables/useLayoutState.ts` for layout state management
- [ ] T012 [P] Create useNavigation composable in `app/composables/useNavigation.ts` for navigation state management
- [ ] T013 [P] Create shared design system styles in `app/assets/css/main.css` with CSS variables and base components
- [ ] T014 [P] Create frontend-specific styles in `app/assets/css/frontend.css` for frontend layout variants
- [ ] T015 [P] Create admin-specific styles in `app/assets/css/admin.css` for admin layout variants and sidebar behavior

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Frontend Visitor Navigation (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Implement frontend layout with header, footer, navigation supporting homepage and info page with consistent SSR rendering

**Independent Test**: Visit homepage and info page, verify consistent layout with navigation, header, footer, and responsive behavior across breakpoints

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Create AppHeader component in `app/components/layout/AppHeader.vue` with frontend/admin context adaptation
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Create AppFooter component in `app/components/layout/AppFooter.vue` with site links and branding
- [ ] T018 [US1] Create default frontend layout in `app/layouts/default.vue` integrating header, footer, and SSR configuration
- [ ] T019 [P] [US1] Create homepage in `app/pages/index.vue` using default layout with frontend content and SEO meta tags
- [ ] T020 [P] [US1] Create info page in `app/pages/info.vue` using default layout with consistent navigation and branding
- [ ] T021 [P] [US1] Add comprehensive SEO meta tags and structured data to frontend pages for search optimization
- [ ] T022 [US1] Configure route rules in `nuxt.config.ts` for SSR rendering mode on frontend pages
- [ ] T023 [US1] Integrate layout store and navigation store with frontend layout for active navigation states
- [ ] T024 [US1] Implement responsive navigation behavior in AppHeader component with mobile breakpoint handling

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - frontend layout with homepage/info page navigation

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Admin User Access and Navigation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement admin layout with collapsible sidebar navigation accessible via /admin/\* URLs with CSR rendering

**Independent Test**: Access /admin/\* URLs, verify distinct admin layout with collapsible sidebar, header (no footer), and persistent sidebar state

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Create AdminSidebar component in `app/components/layout/AdminSidebar.vue` with collapsible functionality and icon/label states
- [ ] T024 [US2] Create admin layout in `app/layouts/admin.vue` integrating header, sidebar, and CSR configuration
- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Create admin dashboard page in `app/pages/admin/index.vue` using admin layout with dashboard content
- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Create additional admin page in `app/pages/admin/settings.vue` to validate admin layout consistency
- [ ] T027 [US2] Configure route rules in `nuxt.config.ts` for CSR rendering mode on admin pages (/admin/\*)
- [ ] T028 [US2] Implement sidebar collapse/expand functionality with Pinia store integration and state persistence
- [ ] T029 [US2] Add CSS animations for smooth sidebar transitions in `app/assets/css/admin.css`
- [ ] T030 [US2] Implement responsive sidebar behavior with auto-collapse on mobile breakpoints
- [ ] T031 [US2] Update AppHeader component to support admin context with admin-specific navigation (no footer dependency)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - distinct frontend and admin layouts

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Layout Validation and Testing (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Validate both layout systems function correctly with proper separation, responsive behavior, and no cross-contamination

**Independent Test**: Systematically access all pages in both layouts, verify layout consistency, responsive behavior, and proper isolation between layouts

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Add layout conflict prevention logic in layout components to ensure proper context isolation
- [ ] T036 [P] [US3] Implement layout validation utilities in `app/composables/useLayoutValidation.ts` for cross-layout testing
- [ ] T037 [P] [US3] Create layout conflict detection middleware in `app/middleware/layout-guard.ts` to prevent style bleeding between contexts
- [ ] T038 [US3] Add comprehensive responsive testing across all defined breakpoints (mobile <768px, tablet 768-1024px, desktop >1024px)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1, independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 completion - requires both layouts to exist for validation

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Header/Footer components before layout integration, pages after layout creation
- **US2**: AdminSidebar component before admin layout, store integration before sidebar functionality
- **US3**: All validation tasks can run in parallel once US1 and US2 are complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- US1 and US2 can be developed in parallel once Foundational phase completes
- Component creation within each story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch component creation for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create AppHeader component in app/components/layout/AppHeader.vue"
Task: "Create AppFooter component in app/components/layout/AppFooter.vue"
Task: "Create homepage in app/pages/index.vue"
Task: "Create info page in app/pages/info.vue"

# Then integrate sequentially:
Task: "Create default frontend layout integrating components"
Task: "Configure route rules and integrate stores"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch admin-specific components for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create AdminSidebar component in app/components/layout/AdminSidebar.vue"
Task: "Create admin dashboard page in app/pages/admin/index.vue"
Task: "Create additional admin page in app/pages/admin/settings.vue"

# Then integrate sequentially:
Task: "Create admin layout integrating sidebar and header"
Task: "Configure CSR route rules and implement sidebar functionality"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test frontend layout independently with homepage/info navigation
5. Deploy/demo if ready - functional website with consistent layout

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP with frontend layout!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Add admin capabilities)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full validation and polish)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Frontend layout)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Admin layout)
3. Both stories complete independently, then User Story 3 validates integration

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on layout functionality first, optimization second
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Layout components should be reusable and follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
