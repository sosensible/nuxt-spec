# Research: Dual Layout System with Admin and Frontend Sections

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Feature**: 001-layout-based-we  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Analysis

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Nuxt 4 Layout System Architecture

**Decision**: Use Nuxt 4's file-based layout system with two distinct layout files (`default.vue` and `admin.vue`)

**Rationale**:

- Nuxt 4's layout system provides automatic layout resolution based on page directory structure
- File-based layouts enable clear separation between frontend and admin experiences
- Supports both SSR (frontend) and CSR (admin) rendering strategies within the same application
- Automatic layout inheritance reduces boilerplate and ensures consistency

**Alternatives considered**:

- Single layout with conditional rendering: Rejected due to complexity and potential layout conflicts
- Component-based layout composition: Rejected as it adds unnecessary abstraction over Nuxt's built-in system
- External layout library: Rejected as Nuxt 4's native layout system meets all requirements

### 2. Nuxt UI 4 Component Strategy for Dual Layouts

**Decision**: Use Nuxt UI 4 base components with custom layout-specific wrapper components

**Rationale**:

- Nuxt UI 4 provides consistent design system foundation with Tailwind CSS integration
- Base components (UButton, UCard, UContainer) can be composed into layout-specific components
- Theme customization through Tailwind config enables layout-specific styling variants
- Maintains component reusability while allowing distinct visual experiences

**Alternatives considered**:

- Completely separate component libraries: Rejected due to maintenance overhead and inconsistency
- Single monolithic components: Rejected as it violates modular architecture principles
- CSS-only styling differences: Rejected as it doesn't provide enough layout-specific functionality

### 3. Responsive Breakpoint Implementation with Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS default breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px) with custom responsive utilities

**Rationale**:

- Aligns with project requirement for standard web breakpoints (mobile <768px, tablet 768-1024px, desktop >1024px)
- Tailwind's responsive design utilities provide consistent breakpoint behavior
- Nuxt UI 4 components are built with Tailwind responsive patterns
- Enables mobile-first responsive design approach

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom CSS media queries: Rejected as Tailwind provides better maintainability and consistency
- CSS Grid/Flexbox only: Rejected as Tailwind responsive utilities provide more comprehensive solution
- JavaScript-based responsive handling: Rejected as CSS-based approach is more performant

### 4. Admin Sidebar Navigation Implementation Pattern

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 Composition API with Pinia store for sidebar state management and Nuxt UI components for UI

**Rationale**:

- Composition API provides reactive sidebar collapse/expand state management
- Pinia store enables state persistence across admin page navigation
- Nuxt UI navigation components provide accessibility and keyboard navigation
- CSS transitions handle smooth collapse/expand animations

**Alternatives considered**:

- Pure CSS-based sidebar: Rejected as it lacks state persistence across page changes
- Vuex for state management: Rejected as Pinia is the recommended state management for Vue 3
- Custom JavaScript animations: Rejected as CSS transitions provide better performance

### 5. URL Structure and Routing Strategy

**Decision**: Use Nuxt 4 file-based routing with `/admin/*` directory structure for admin section

**Rationale**:

- File-based routing provides intuitive URL structure matching directory layout
- `/admin/*` pattern is web standard for administrative interfaces
- Automatic route generation reduces configuration overhead
- Supports both nested routes and layout inheritance

**Alternatives considered**:

- Programmatic routing: Rejected as file-based routing is simpler and more maintainable
- Query parameter differentiation: Rejected as URL structure is less intuitive
- Subdomain approach: Rejected as it adds deployment complexity

### 6. Type Safety Strategy for Layout System

**Decision**: Dedicated TypeScript definition files for layout types (`types/layout.ts`) and admin-specific types (`types/admin.ts`)

**Rationale**:

- Separation of concerns between common layout types and admin-specific types
- Enables strong typing for layout component props and state management
- Supports IntelliSense and compile-time error checking
- Aligns with TypeScript strict mode requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Single types file: Rejected as it doesn't provide clear separation between layout contexts
- Inline types: Rejected as it reduces reusability and discoverability
- Auto-generated types only: Rejected as layout types require manual definition for proper structure

## Technology Integration Decisions

### Framework Integration

- **Nuxt 4**: Core framework providing universal rendering, file-based routing, and layout system
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Component architecture for layout components and state management
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode for type safety across layout system

### UI/Styling Stack

- **Nuxt UI 4**: Base component library providing consistent design system
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design and styling variants
- **Custom CSS**: Layout-specific styling for frontend and admin variants

### State Management

- **Pinia**: Store management for layout state (sidebar collapse, navigation state)
- **Vue 3 Reactivity**: Component-level state for layout interactions

### Testing Strategy

- **Nuxt Test Utils**: Component testing for layout components
- **Playwright**: E2E testing for layout navigation and responsive behavior
- **Vitest**: Unit testing for composables and state management

## Implementation Readiness

All research tasks completed successfully. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain. Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.

**Next Phase**: Generate data-model.md, contracts/ (if applicable), and quickstart.md.
