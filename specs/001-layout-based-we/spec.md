# Feature Specification: Dual Layout System with Admin and Frontend Sections

**Feature Branch**: `001-layout-based-we`  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "layout based - We want to build a layout with a admin section and with a front end section that includes basic home page, info page site so we can validate the layout. The layout needs to have a default layout for the front end and a secondary layout for the back end."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: Admin Section URL Structure → A: Dedicated subdirectory (/admin/\*)
- Q: Visual Layout Components → A: Header/Footer/Sidebar components (admin has sidebar, frontend has footer)
- Q: Layout Responsive Breakpoints → A: Standard web breakpoints (mobile: <768px, tablet: 768-1024px, desktop: >1024px)
- Q: Admin Sidebar Navigation Style → A: Collapsible sidebar with icons (can expand/collapse, shows icons when collapsed)
- Q: Layout Theme/Styling Approach → A: Shared design system with layout-specific variants (common colors/fonts, different layouts)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Frontend Visitor Navigation (Priority: P1)

A website visitor needs to browse the public-facing site with a consistent and professional layout that provides easy navigation between pages.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user-facing experience and represents the core value delivery. Without a functional frontend layout, visitors cannot access content or navigate the site effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage and info page, verifying consistent navigation, branding, and layout elements across both pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor accesses the homepage, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a consistent frontend layout with navigation, header, footer, and main content area
2. **Given** a visitor is on the homepage, **When** they click the info page link, **Then** they navigate to the info page with the same layout structure maintained
3. **Given** a visitor is on any frontend page, **When** they interact with navigation elements, **Then** they can easily identify their current location and available pages

---

### User Story 2 - Admin User Access and Navigation (Priority: P2)

An administrative user needs to access a dedicated admin section with a specialized layout optimized for management tasks and administrative workflows.

**Why this priority**: Essential for content management and site administration, but secondary to the public-facing experience. Admin functionality enables site maintenance and content updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the admin section and verifying the distinct layout, navigation structure, and administrative interface elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin user accesses the admin section, **When** they view the admin interface, **Then** they see a specialized admin layout distinct from the frontend layout
2. **Given** an admin user is in the admin section, **When** they navigate between admin pages, **Then** the admin layout structure remains consistent
3. **Given** an admin user switches between admin and frontend sections, **When** they navigate, **Then** each section maintains its appropriate layout without cross-contamination

---

### User Story 3 - Layout Validation and Testing (Priority: P3)

Developers and stakeholders need to validate that both layout systems function correctly and maintain their distinct visual and functional characteristics across different pages and user types.

**Why this priority**: Important for quality assurance and future development, but not critical for initial user value delivery. This enables confident expansion of the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by systematically accessing all pages in both frontend and admin sections, verifying layout consistency, responsive behavior, and proper separation between the two systems.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** both layout systems are implemented, **When** pages are accessed in different browsers and devices, **Then** each layout maintains its intended appearance and functionality
2. **Given** a user switches between frontend and admin sections, **When** they navigate back and forth, **Then** no layout conflicts or styling issues occur
3. **Given** new pages are added to either section, **When** they inherit their respective layouts, **Then** they automatically receive the correct styling and navigation structure

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a frontend user attempts to access admin-only URLs?
- How does the system handle layout conflicts if shared components exist between admin and frontend?
- What occurs when admin navigation includes too many items for the layout structure?
- How does the system behave when JavaScript is disabled and layouts need to degrade gracefully?

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can navigate between homepage and info page within 2 seconds with consistent layout presentation
- **SC-002**: Admin users can access and navigate the admin section with 100% layout consistency across admin pages
- **SC-003**: Both layout systems maintain visual integrity across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports (responsive design validation)
- **SC-004**: Zero layout conflicts occur when switching between frontend and admin sections during user sessions
- **SC-005**: Development team can create new pages in either section with automatic layout inheritance requiring no additional layout configuration

## Assumptions

- Admin access will be restricted to authorized users (specific authentication method to be clarified)
- Both layouts will need to be responsive across common device sizes
- Frontend pages prioritize SEO and public accessibility while admin pages prioritize functionality and user experience for authenticated users
- The system will be built using Nuxt.js layout capabilities and Vue.js component architecture
- Basic branding elements (colors, fonts, logos) will be consistent between layouts but applied differently based on context
