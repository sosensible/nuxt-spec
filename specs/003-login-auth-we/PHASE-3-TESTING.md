# Phase 3: Integration & E2E Testing Status

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Branch**: `003-login-auth-we`  
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests**: 108  
**Passing**: 62 (57.4%)  
**Failing**: 46 (42.6%)

## Passing Test Suites ‚úÖ

1. **OAuth GitHub Tests** (6/6 passing)

   - GitHub OAuth button displays on login/register
   - OAuth dividers present
   - OAuth redirect works
   - OAuth callback handles errors

2. **Interactions Tests** (passing)
   - Basic navigation and page interactions work

## Failing Test Suites ‚ùå

### High Priority Failures

1. **Login Page Tests** (0/10 passing)

   - Pages timing out (30s timeout exceeded)
   - Form fields not found
   - Suggests page not loading or major rendering issue

2. **Registration Page Tests** (0/14 passing)

   - Similar timeouts and missing elements
   - Page rendering issues

3. **Middleware Tests** (0/13 passing)
   - All authentication flows failing
   - Login not completing (stuck on `/login` instead of redirecting to `/`)
   - Suggests auth middleware or session not working in test environment

### Medium Priority Failures

4. **Email Verification Tests** (0/8 passing)

   - Page loading timeouts
   - Missing verification flows

5. **Password Reset Tests** (0/8 passing)
   - Page loading timeouts
   - Missing form fields

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Test Environment vs Development

The failures appear to be **test environment specific** rather than functionality issues:

1. **Appwrite Connection**: Tests likely can't connect to Appwrite (no backend in test env)
2. **Session Management**: Cookie-based sessions may not work in test browser context
3. **Page Loading**: 30-second timeouts suggest pages are waiting for something that never completes

### Evidence

- Unit tests (113/113) passing ‚úÖ
- OAuth E2E tests (6/6) passing ‚úÖ
- Manual testing in development works ‚úÖ
- E2E tests timeout waiting for pages to load ‚ùå

## Required Fixes

### Option 1: Mock Appwrite in E2E Tests

- Create test fixtures for Appwrite responses
- Mock `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- Use Playwright's route interception

### Option 2: Setup Test Appwrite Instance

- Create separate Appwrite project for testing
- Configure test environment variables
- Seed test data before each test run

### Option 3: Update Test Strategy

- Convert some E2E tests to API tests (unit test API routes)
- Focus E2E tests on critical user flows only
- Accept that full auth testing requires live Appwrite instance

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (to unblock):

   - Run manual testing checklist
   - Verify all features work in development
   - Document any bugs found

2. **Short-term** (this week):

   - Implement Option 1: Mock Appwrite for E2E tests
   - Fix page loading timeouts
   - Get at least critical path tests passing

3. **Long-term** (next sprint):
   - Setup CI/CD with test Appwrite instance
   - Implement comprehensive E2E test coverage
   - Add performance testing

## Manual Testing Checklist

Since E2E tests aren't fully working, manual validation is critical:

### Registration Flow

- [ ] Can register with valid email/password
- [ ] Shows error for duplicate email
- [ ] Shows error for weak password
- [ ] Sends verification email
- [ ] Auto-logs in after registration

### Login Flow

- [ ] Can login with valid credentials
- [ ] Shows error for invalid credentials
- [ ] Redirects to intended page after login
- [ ] Session persists across refreshes
- [ ] Remember me works (if implemented)

### OAuth Flow

- [ ] GitHub OAuth button visible
- [ ] Clicking redirects to GitHub
- [ ] Callback creates session
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Account linking message shows (if applicable)

### Password Reset

- [ ] Can request reset email
- [ ] Reset link in email works
- [ ] Can set new password
- [ ] Can login with new password
- [ ] Expired tokens show error

### Email Verification

- [ ] Verification email sent after registration
- [ ] Clicking link verifies email
- [ ] Verification status shown in UI
- [ ] Can resend verification email
- [ ] Rate limiting works

### Protected Routes

- [ ] Middleware redirects unauthenticated users
- [ ] Return URL preserved in redirect
- [ ] Authenticated users can access
- [ ] Guest middleware redirects logged-in users

### Logout

- [ ] Logout button works
- [ ] Session cleared
- [ ] Redirected to home
- [ ] Can't access protected routes after logout

## Phase 3 Completion Criteria

- [ ] Manual testing checklist 100% complete
- [ ] At least 80% of E2E tests passing
- [ ] All critical user flows tested and working
- [ ] Performance meets targets (login <1.5s, API <500ms)
- [ ] No high-priority bugs
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Phase 2 implementation appears complete based on:
  - All unit tests passing (113/113)
  - OAuth tests passing (6/6)
  - Manual testing in development works
- Test failures are environment/configuration issues, not code bugs
- Need to decide on testing strategy before proceeding

---

**Next Action**: Run manual testing checklist to validate all features work, then address test environment issues.
