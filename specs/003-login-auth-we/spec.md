# Feature Specification: Authentication System with Appwrite

**Feature Branch**: `003-login-auth-we`  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Ready for Implementation  
**Input**: User description: "login auth - We want to use Appwrite to create a login feature for the site using github with oauth, and using classic email password logins. If something needs to be set up on the back end, prompt me for those steps. This should include login, register, reset password, and trigger oauth registrations and logins."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Email/Password Registration and Login (Priority: P1)

Users need to create accounts and log in using email and password to access protected areas of the site, establishing their identity and persisting their session across visits.

**Why this priority**: Core authentication mechanism that enables all other user-specific features. Email/password is the most common authentication method and serves as a fallback when OAuth providers are unavailable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing registration form, receiving verification email, logging in with credentials, and accessing protected content. Delivers basic account creation and login functionality independently of OAuth.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the registration page, **When** they submit valid email and password, **Then** their account is created and they receive a verification email
2. **Given** a registered user with verified email, **When** they submit correct credentials on login page, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their intended destination
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they refresh the page or return later, **Then** their session persists and they remain logged in
4. **Given** a user with unverified email, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** they see a message prompting them to verify their email first
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click logout, **Then** their session ends and they are redirected to the home page

---

### User Story 2 - Password Reset Flow (Priority: P2)

Users who forget their password need a secure way to reset it via email verification, ensuring they can regain access to their account without contacting support.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user retention and account recovery. Users frequently forget passwords, and a self-service reset flow reduces support burden and improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting password reset, receiving reset email, clicking link, setting new password, and logging in with new credentials. Works independently of registration and OAuth flows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the login page, **When** they click "Forgot Password" and enter their email, **Then** they receive a password reset email with a secure link
2. **Given** a user clicks the reset link in email, **When** they are redirected to reset password page, **Then** they can enter and confirm a new password
3. **Given** a user submits a new password, **When** the password meets requirements, **Then** their password is updated and they can log in with the new password
4. **Given** a user tries to use an expired reset link, **When** they click it, **Then** they see an error message and option to request a new reset link
5. **Given** a user enters a non-existent email for reset, **When** they submit, **Then** they see a generic success message (security: don't reveal which emails exist)

---

### User Story 3 - GitHub OAuth Registration and Login (Priority: P2)

Users want to sign up or log in quickly using their GitHub account, avoiding password management and leveraging existing trusted identity verification.

**Why this priority**: OAuth significantly improves conversion rates for registration and reduces friction. GitHub OAuth is particularly relevant for developer-focused applications and technical audiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking "Sign in with GitHub", authorizing the app, being redirected back, and accessing protected content. Works as a standalone registration/login method independently of email/password.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user on the registration page, **When** they click "Sign up with GitHub" and authorize the app, **Then** their account is created using GitHub profile data and they are logged in
2. **Given** an existing user with GitHub OAuth, **When** they click "Sign in with GitHub" and authorize, **Then** they are authenticated and logged in
3. **Given** a user authorizes GitHub OAuth, **When** the redirect completes, **Then** their session is established and they are redirected to their intended destination
4. **Given** a user's GitHub email matches an existing email/password account, **When** they use GitHub OAuth, **Then** they see a message that an account exists and must log in with password first, then can link GitHub OAuth in account settings
5. **Given** a user denies GitHub authorization, **When** they are redirected back, **Then** they see a message explaining why authorization is needed and can try again

---

### User Story 4 - Email Verification (Priority: P3)

Users who register with email/password must verify their email address to ensure account security and enable password reset functionality, preventing fake accounts and ensuring valid contact information.

**Why this priority**: Important for security and account recovery, but users can still register and begin using the site with limited functionality. Can be implemented after core registration/login works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering, receiving verification email, clicking verification link, and gaining full account access. Works independently as an optional security layer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user completes registration, **When** they check their email inbox, **Then** they receive a verification email with a secure link
2. **Given** a user clicks the verification link, **When** the link is valid, **Then** their email is marked as verified and they can access all features
3. **Given** a user with unverified email, **When** they attempt actions requiring verification, **Then** they see a prompt to verify their email with option to resend verification email
4. **Given** a user requests a new verification email, **When** they click "Resend", **Then** a new verification email is sent after rate limiting check
5. **Given** a user tries to use an expired verification link, **When** they click it, **Then** they see an error and option to request a new verification email

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to register with an email that already exists? (Show user-friendly error: "An account with this email already exists. Try logging in or resetting your password.")
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from different devices? (Allow multiple active sessions per user account)
- What happens if GitHub OAuth fails or times out? (Show error message with option to retry or use email/password instead)
- How does the system handle password reset requests for non-existent emails? (Show generic success message to prevent email enumeration attacks)
- What happens when a user tries to verify their email multiple times with the same link? (First click succeeds, subsequent clicks show "Email already verified")
- How does the system handle expired verification or reset tokens? (Show appropriate error message with option to request new link)
- What happens if Appwrite service is temporarily unavailable? (Show user-friendly error message with retry option, don't expose technical details)
- How does the system handle users who close the browser during OAuth redirect? (OAuth state is lost, user must restart the process)
- What happens when a user changes their GitHub email after linking their account? (User can still log in; GitHub provides consistent user ID regardless of email changes)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users can register with email and password, providing name, email (unique), and password (min 8 characters)
- **FR-002**: System validates password strength (min 8 chars, includes uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- **FR-003**: System sends verification email upon registration with secure token (1-hour expiration)
- **FR-004**: Users can verify email by clicking link in verification email
- **FR-005**: Users can log in with verified email and password
- **FR-006**: System creates persistent session upon successful login (14-day default expiration)
- **FR-007**: Users can log out, which terminates their session
- **FR-008**: Users can request password reset by providing email
- **FR-009**: System sends password reset email with secure token (1-hour expiration)
- **FR-010**: Users can reset password by clicking link and providing new password
- **FR-011**: Password reset tokens are single-use only
- **FR-012**: Users can register/login via GitHub OAuth
- **FR-013**: System retrieves user profile from GitHub (name, email, avatar) on OAuth success
- **FR-014**: System creates new account for GitHub OAuth users; if GitHub email matches existing email/password account, system shows message requiring password login first and account linking in settings
- **FR-015**: Users can resend verification email (rate limited: 1 per 60 seconds)
- **FR-016**: System prevents registration with duplicate emails (case-insensitive)
- **FR-017**: All authentication errors show user-friendly messages without exposing security details
- **FR-018**: System logs authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts) for security monitoring
- **FR-019**: Unverified users can log in but see verification prompt
- **FR-020**: System invalidates all user sessions on password change

### Nuxt-Specific Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Authentication state uses SSR-compatible `useState` composable for shared state across client and server
- **NFR-002**: Protected routes use `definePageMeta` with `middleware: 'auth'` to enforce authentication
- **NFR-003**: Auth middleware (`middleware/auth.ts`) checks session on server-side and redirects unauthenticated users to login
- **NFR-004**: Login and registration forms use Nuxt UI v4 `<UForm>` component with Zod schema validation and `<UFormGroup>` + `<UInput>` for fields
- **NFR-005**: API routes (`server/api/auth/*`) handle authentication operations (register, login, logout, verify, reset)
- **NFR-006**: Appwrite SDK calls are server-side only (via API routes), never exposed to client
- **NFR-007**: OAuth callback handled by `server/api/auth/callback/github.ts` route
- **NFR-008**: Auth composable (`useAuth`) provides reactive user state and methods (`login`, `logout`, `register`, `checkAuth`)

### Key Entities

**User Account**:

- `$id`: string (Appwrite auto-generated)
- `email`: string (unique, lowercase)
- `name`: string
- `emailVerification`: boolean
- `prefs`: object (avatar URL if GitHub OAuth used)

- `userId`: string (reference to User Account)
- `provider`: string (`email`, `github`)
- `expire`: timestamp
- `current`: boolean

**Verification Token** (managed by Appwrite):

- `secret`: string (secure token)
- `expire`: timestamp
- `userId`: string

- [ ] Test auth middleware: redirects to login when no session exists
- [ ] Test auth middleware: allows access when valid session exists
- [ ] Test auth middleware: preserves return URL in redirect query param
- [ ] Test password validation: rejects passwords under 8 characters
- [ ] Test password validation: rejects passwords without uppercase/lowercase/number/special char
- [ ] Test password validation: accepts valid passwords
- [ ] Test email validation: rejects invalid email formats and normalizes to lowercase
- [ ] Test session persistence: session state survives page refresh
- [ ] Test logout: clears session state and cookies

**API Contract Tests** (Vitest):

- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/register`: returns 400 when email already exists or password is invalid
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/login`: returns 200 with session on valid credentials
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/login`: returns 401 on invalid credentials
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/logout`: returns 200 and terminates session
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/password-reset`: returns 200 on valid email (even if email doesn't exist for security)
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/password-reset/confirm`: returns 200 on successful reset, 400 on expired token
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/verify-email`: returns 200 on successful verification, 400 on expired token
- [ ] Test POST `/api/auth/verify-email/resend`: returns 200 and sends new email, 429 when rate limited
- [ ] Test GET `/api/auth/callback/github`: creates session on successful OAuth, returns 400 on error

**E2E Tests** (Playwright):

- [ ] Test complete registration flow: fill form â†’ submit â†’ verify email received â†’ click link â†’ email verified
- [ ] Test complete login flow: navigate to login â†’ enter credentials â†’ submit â†’ redirected to protected page

- [ ] Email verification required setting configured (recommend: enabled)
- [ ] Session length configured (recommend: 14 days)
- [ ] Password dictionary check enabled (prevents common passwords)

### 3. OAuth Provider Configuration (GitHub)

- [ ] GitHub OAuth app created at https://github.com/settings/developers
- [ ] GitHub app callback URL configured: `https://[your-domain]/api/auth/callback/github` (dev: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`)
- [ ] GitHub Client ID and Client Secret obtained
- [ ] GitHub OAuth provider enabled in Appwrite console (Auth â†’ Settings â†’ OAuth2 Providers â†’ GitHub)
- [ ] GitHub Client ID and Client Secret added to Appwrite GitHub OAuth configuration

### 4. Email Service Configuration

- [ ] Email service provider configured in Appwrite (Appwrite â†’ Settings â†’ SMTP)
- [ ] Sender email address and name configured
- [ ] Email templates customized (optional):
  - Verification email template
  - Password reset email template
- [ ] Test emails sent successfully to verify SMTP configuration

### 5. Security & Rate Limiting

- [ ] Rate limiting configured for authentication endpoints (recommend: 10 attempts per hour per IP)
- [ ] Password requirements set (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- [ ] Account lockout policy configured (optional: 5 failed attempts = 15 min lockout)

### 6. Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id

```

---

## Assumptions

1. **Appwrite Infrastructure**: Using Appwrite Cloud or self-hosted instance with version 1.4+ (includes OAuth2 support)
2. **Email Service**: Email delivery is configured and working in Appwrite (SMTP or email provider integration)
3. **HTTPS Required**: Production deployment uses HTTPS (required for OAuth and secure cookies)
4. **Session Storage**: Using HTTP-only cookies for session tokens (more secure than localStorage)
5. **User Data**: GitHub OAuth provides user's public email; private emails will be handled by prompting user
6. **Account Linking**: Manual confirmation required for linking OAuth to existing email/password account (security over convenience)
7. **Email Uniqueness**: Email addresses are unique across all users (case-insensitive)
8. **Verification Tokens**: Appwrite manages token generation, expiration, and validation
9. **Rate Limiting**: Appwrite handles rate limiting for authentication endpoints
10. **Error Messages**: Appwrite error codes are mapped to user-friendly messages in API routes
11. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with cookie support (no IE11)
12. **JavaScript Enabled**: Authentication features require JavaScript (SSR pages but client-side interactions)
13. **Mobile Responsive**: All authentication pages work on mobile devices (375px minimum width)
14. **Dark Mode**: Authentication pages support dark mode via Tailwind dark: variants

## Open Questions

### Account Linking Strategy âœ… Resolved

**Question**: When a user signs in with GitHub OAuth and their GitHub email matches an existing email/password account, what should happen?

**Context**: This scenario occurs when:

1. User registers with email/password (`user@example.com`)
2. Later, user clicks "Sign in with GitHub" with same email

**Decision**: **Option B: Manual Confirmation**

**Rationale**: Security takes priority over convenience. Users must:

1. Log in with their existing password first
2. Navigate to account settings
3. Explicitly link their GitHub OAuth account

This prevents unauthorized account access if someone gains control of a user's GitHub account or email address.

**Implementation Notes**:

- When GitHub OAuth detects matching email, show message: "An account already exists with this email. Please log in with your password, then you can link your GitHub account in settings."
- Add "Link GitHub Account" option in user account settings page
- Linking requires current password confirmation for additional security
- Once linked, user can log in with either method (email/password OR GitHub OAuth)
