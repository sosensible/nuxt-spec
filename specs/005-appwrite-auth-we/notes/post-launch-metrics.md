# Post-launch Metrics & Measurement Plan

These metrics are post-launch targets to validate product impact and performance after the Admin Users feature is live in production. They are intentionally deferred from the MVP branch and should be scheduled in a follow-up launch/observability phase.

Metrics (quantitative targets):

- SC-001: First page of `/admin/users` renders within 2 seconds under nominal production latency.

  - Measurement: synthetic load test and real-user monitoring (RUM) during a 7-day window after launch.
  - Owner: Frontend engineering / Performance lead.
  - Acceptance: 95th percentile page load <= 2s.

- SC-002: 95% of Edit operations complete successfully and the UI reflects Appwrite state within 3 seconds.

  - Measurement: instrument edit API endpoints and client instrumentation to measure end-to-end time and success rate over a 7-day window.
  - Owner: Backend engineering / API owner.
  - Acceptance: >=95% success rate and median update reflection time <=3s.

- SC-003: 100% of confirmed deletes remove the user from the list and Appwrite returns success within 5 seconds in nominal conditions.

  - Measurement: transaction logs for delete operations and UI confirmation latency measured in staging and production sampling.
  - Owner: Backend engineering / Security owner.
  - Acceptance: All confirmed deletes complete and reflect in UI within 5s in nominal conditions; any failures investigated as incidents.

- SC-004: 90% of searches return the expected user in the first page for test datasets.
  - Measurement: run search correctness tests against representative datasets and measure first-page hit rate.
  - Owner: QA / Backend.
  - Acceptance: >=90% first-page hit rate for representative queries.

Qualitative metric:

- Operators report that the UI matches Appwrite authoritative data and that edit/delete flows behave predictably.
  - Measurement: operator feedback survey and support ticket analysis in the first 30 days.
  - Owner: Product / Support.

When to run

- Schedule these measurements during a defined launch window after feature rollout to a production environment. The recommended cadence is: Day 1 (smoke), Day 7 (initial stability window), Day 30 (post-launch review).

Notes

- Ensure necessary telemetry (RUM, API metrics, logs) and instrumentation are in place before the launch window.
- Define success owners and runbooks for handling failures or regressions uncovered by these metrics.
