# Checklist: API & Auth Requirements Quality (Appwrite-auth)

Purpose: Validate the quality, clarity and completeness of API and authentication-related requirements for the Appwrite-backed `/admin/users` feature.
Created: 2025-10-25
Feature: `../spec.md`

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are the required API endpoints for listing, updating and deleting users explicitly specified (parameters, path, and intent)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001/FR-004/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the paging contract described in sufficient detail (pageSize param, cursor vs offset fallback, cursor format, and behavior when totalCount is unavailable)? [Completeness, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are authorization rules for server-side proxy routes defined (which in-app operator role(s) can call each endpoint)? [Completeness, Spec §Operator permissions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 - Is the expected error-response shape documented or explicitly deferred (i.e., error code categories, message format) for API failures? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is the expected behavior when Appwrite returns partial results or omits exact totals clearly specified (how the UI should present approximate counts)? [Clarity, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 - Are paging behaviors consistent across list, filtering, and search scenarios (cursor usage, pageSize handling, and selection restore expectations)? [Consistency, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
- [ ] CHK007 - Do the edit and delete requirement statements align with the API error handling and retry guidance (no conflicting recovery expectations)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004/FR-005/Edge Cases]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 - Are acceptance criteria for API interactions measurable and actionable (e.g., request/response examples, required fields for PATCH, expected success response codes)? [Measurability, Spec §FR-002/FR-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 - Are failure and retry modes for Appwrite connectivity covered in requirements (e.g., user-visible messages, retry semantics, server-side fallbacks)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are concurrent-edit conflict scenarios specified (what Appwrite returns on conflict and how the UI should present/resolve it)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 - Are the implications of hard-delete documented in requirements (audit / irreversible action guidance, required confirmation details) or marked as a gap? [Edge Case, Spec §Delete semantics]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are limits/guardrails defined for pageSize and maximum result set sizes to prevent excessive server load? [Edge Case, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK013 - Is the assumption that admin Appwrite keys will be used only server-side and that a proxy exists explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are external dependencies (Appwrite features such as cursors, totalCount availability) and their effect on API contract clearly called out? [Dependency, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK015 - Is the mapping between 'elevated in-app admin role' and Appwrite teams/roles clarified, or is this left ambiguous and scheduled for follow-up? [Ambiguity, Spec §Operator permissions]

Notes:

- This checklist focuses on requirements quality for API and authentication; NFRs and traceability items were intentionally excluded per request. Each item references spec sections where applicable. Create follow-up checklists for UX, security, or performance if needed.
