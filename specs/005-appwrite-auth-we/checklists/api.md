# Checklist: API & Auth Requirements Quality (Appwrite-auth)

Purpose: Validate the quality, clarity and completeness of API and authentication-related requirements for the Appwrite-backed `/admin/users` feature.
Created: 2025-10-25
Feature: `../spec.md`

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 - Are the required API endpoints for listing, updating and deleting users explicitly specified (parameters, path, and intent)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001/FR-004/FR-005]
      ✓ PASS: contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md documents GET /api/admin/users (with pageSize, cursor, offset, q params), PATCH /api/admin/users/:id, DELETE /api/admin/users/:id with full intent and example implementations
- [x] CHK002 - Is the paging contract described in sufficient detail (pageSize param, cursor vs offset fallback, cursor format, and behavior when totalCount is unavailable)? [Completeness, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Pagination & Navigation specifies default 25, options {10,25,50}, cursor-first with offset fallback, approximate count display when totalCount unavailable, cursor preservation during navigation
- [x] CHK003 - Are authorization rules for server-side proxy routes defined (which in-app operator role(s) can call each endpoint)? [Completeness, Spec §Operator permissions]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Operator permissions defines "elevated in-app admin role" requirement, FR-006 states operators with elevated admin role see Edit/Delete controls, contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md §Security notes authentication/authorization check requirement

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 - Is the expected error-response shape documented or explicitly deferred (i.e., error code categories, message format) for API failures? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
      ✓ PASS: contracts/types.d.ts defines ApiError interface with code/message shape, contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md §Error handling specifies normalized error format { error: { code: string, message: string } } for all endpoints
- [x] CHK005 - Is the expected behavior when Appwrite returns partial results or omits exact totals clearly specified (how the UI should present approximate counts)? [Clarity, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Pagination & Navigation states "If an exact total is not available, display an approximate indicator" with example "Showing 26–50 of ~12,345", contracts/types.d.ts PagedResponse has totalCount?: number | null

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK006 - Are paging behaviors consistent across list, filtering, and search scenarios (cursor usage, pageSize handling, and selection restore expectations)? [Consistency, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Pagination & Navigation and contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md use same cursor/pageSize/offset pattern for all queries including search (q param), frontend-examples.ts demonstrates consistent cursor stack management across navigation
- [x] CHK007 - Do the edit and delete requirement statements align with the API error handling and retry guidance (no conflicting recovery expectations)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004/FR-005/Edge Cases]
      ✓ PASS: FR-004/FR-005 specify "refresh affected row on success" and "UI updates after success", FR-007 requires "clear, actionable error messages" and "allow retry where appropriate", contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md error handling returns normalized error shape consistently

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK008 - Are acceptance criteria for API interactions measurable and actionable (e.g., request/response examples, required fields for PATCH, expected success response codes)? [Measurability, Spec §FR-002/FR-004]
      ✓ PASS: contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md provides explicit code examples with request/response shapes, contracts/types.d.ts defines UpdateUserPayload with whitelisted fields (name, email, customAttributes), contracts documents status codes (204 for DELETE, 400/502 for errors)

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK009 - Are failure and retry modes for Appwrite connectivity covered in requirements (e.g., user-visible messages, retry semantics, server-side fallbacks)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Edge Cases states "Appwrite unreachable: show an error banner and provide retry", FR-007 requires "clear, actionable error messages" and "allow retry where appropriate", contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md normalizes errors and frontend-examples.ts includes error state management
- [x] CHK010 - Are concurrent-edit conflict scenarios specified (what Appwrite returns on conflict and how the UI should present/resolve it)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Edge Cases explicitly states "Concurrent edits: surface conflict/validation messages returned by Appwrite", User Story 2 Acceptance Scenario 3 covers "Given Appwrite rejects update, When Save is clicked, Then popup shows a clear error and remains open"

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK011 - Are the implications of hard-delete documented in requirements (audit / irreversible action guidance, required confirmation details) or marked as a gap? [Edge Case, Spec §Delete semantics]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Delete semantics documents "Hard-delete (permanent removal) for MVP" with note "carries compliance/audit implications", User Story 3 requires "explicit confirmation and awareness of consequences", contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md notes "ensure UI asks for explicit confirmation and shows irreversible-warning"
- [x] CHK012 - Are limits/guardrails defined for pageSize and maximum result set sizes to prevent excessive server load? [Edge Case, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Pagination & Navigation defines pageSize options {10, 25, 50} with default 25, contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md includes `Math.min(Number(pageSize), 50)` limit enforcement in code examples

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK013 - Is the assumption that admin Appwrite keys will be used only server-side and that a proxy exists explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Assumptions states "Admin UI will call Appwrite via secure server-side routes or a service account; admin keys will not be embedded in client code", contracts/usage-with-appwrite.md §Security emphasizes "Keep admin keys and service accounts on the server only", quickstart.md notes "Keep APPWRITE_ADMIN_KEY server-only"
- [x] CHK014 - Are external dependencies (Appwrite features such as cursors, totalCount availability) and their effect on API contract clearly called out? [Dependency, Spec §Pagination & Navigation]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Pagination & Navigation notes "Prefer cursor-based pagination (Appwrite cursors) for performance and correctness when available" with "If cursors are not available for a particular query, support offset/limit as a fallback", contracts/types.d.ts PagedResponse includes optional cursor and totalCount fields with nullability

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK015 - Is the mapping between 'elevated in-app admin role' and Appwrite teams/roles clarified, or is this left ambiguous and scheduled for follow-up? [Ambiguity, Spec §Operator permissions]
      ✓ PASS: spec.md §Operator permissions explicitly addresses this: "Decision: Any authenticated app operator with an elevated in-app admin role (MVP). The UI will show Edit/Delete controls to operators with this elevated role. Revisit and tighten mapping to Appwrite Teams or stricter org-level roles in a follow-up feature." - The ambiguity is acknowledged and deliberately deferred with a clear plan for future refinement

Notes:

- This checklist focuses on requirements quality for API and authentication; NFRs and traceability items were intentionally excluded per request. Each item references spec sections where applicable. Create follow-up checklists for UX, security, or performance if needed.
