# Feature Specification: Upgrade outdated libraries and Nuxt modules

**Feature Branch**: `004-description-we-want`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We want to upgrade any outdated libraries or nuxt modules."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Upgrade detection and proposal (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want the project to identify outdated dependencies and Nuxt modules and generate clear upgrade proposals so I can review and approve updates with minimal manual effort.

**Why this priority**: Keeping dependencies up-to-date reduces security risk, improves performance, and lowers future maintenance burden.

**Independent Test**: Run the detection process and verify a report is produced that lists outdated packages, their current and target versions, and risk notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a repository with dependencies declared, **When** the detection is run, **Then** a report is produced listing all outdated packages grouped by runtime vs dev vs Nuxt modules.
2. **Given** an outdated Nuxt module is identified, **When** the proposal is generated, **Then** the proposal includes compatibility notes and suggested target version.

### User Story 2 - Safe upgrade execution in feature branches (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer or release engineer, I want upgrades applied in isolated branches or proposals so that CI can validate builds and tests before any merge to mainline.

**Why this priority**: Automated upgrades that fail CI could break production; isolating changes protects main branches.

**Independent Test**: Confirm an upgrade proposal results in a branch or patch set that can be built and that tests run against it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an upgrade proposal, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build and tests complete and results are reported back on the proposal.
2. **Given** failing tests on an upgrade branch, **When** the maintainer reviews, **Then** the proposal is marked as blocked and not merged.

---

---

### User Story 3 - Rollback and monitoring (Priority: P3)

As an operations engineer, I want a clear rollback path and monitoring guidance for upgraded components so we can revert quickly if issues occur post-merge.

**Why this priority**: Upgrades may regress behavior; fast rollback and monitoring reduce incident impact.

**Independent Test**: Merge a harmless upgrade in a staging environment, then simulate a failure and confirm rollback steps restore the prior state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a merged upgrade that causes regression in staging, **When** rollback is initiated, **Then** the previous dependency state is restored and tests return to green.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Repositories with non-standard lockfiles (multiple package managers) — detection should surface these and skip or flag them.
- Private/internal packages that require credentials — detection should not attempt to publish credentials and must surface missing access as a blocker.
- Packages pinned to git SHAs or local paths — treat as non-upgradable unless a tag/version is available and note this in the report.
- Large-major upgrades that change public APIs — automation may create major-upgrade proposals but they are high-risk; such proposals MUST pass extended integration tests and a short manual review window before merge.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system/process MUST detect and list all declared dependencies (runtime, dev, and Nuxt modules) that have available newer versions and produce a human-readable report.
- **FR-002**: For each outdated dependency, the report MUST include: current version, latest available version, semantic version diff (major/minor/patch), and a short risk note.
- **FR-003**: The system/process MUST generate upgrade proposals (one or grouped) that can be applied in isolation (e.g., a branch/PR) with changelog notes for maintainers.
- **FR-004**: The system/process MUST run or trigger the project's test suite for each upgrade proposal and surface pass/fail status in the report.
- **FR-005**: The process MUST provide an audit log of upgrades attempted, including timestamps, author (automation or human), and outcome.
- **FR-006**: Upgrades that affect Nuxt modules or core framework integration MUST include compatibility notes and a smoke-check list for critical pages. Scope: All declared Nuxt modules (every module listed in the repository's dependencies and devDependencies) are considered in-scope for detection and automated proposals.
- **FR-007**: Merge to protected branches MUST be gated by test pass and (configurable) human approval for high-risk changes. Policy: manual approval is required only for major/high-risk upgrades; minor and patch upgrades may auto-merge once CI and smoke-tests pass.
  - For repositories with a single maintainer, merges that would modify production dependencies MUST additionally require:
    - 1 maintainer approval, and
    - successful extended CI (integration) test suite, and
    - a successful mandatory staging smoke-test run before merge.

### Nuxt-Specific Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Upgrades to Nuxt modules MUST include a validation step that the site builds successfully (static or server build) and critical routes render without errors in a staging environment.
- **NFR-002**: Upgrades that potentially change SSR/CSR behavior MUST include notes describing expected behavior changes and pages to smoke-test.
- **NFR-003**: The process MUST flag breaking changes in Nuxt-related plugins or modules (e.g., changes to runtime config or plugin hooks) in the upgrade proposal.

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **NFR-006**: Deployment target MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: static site, serverless, Node.js server?]

### Key Entities

- **Dependency**: name, currentVersion, latestVersion, scope (runtime/dev/nuxt-module), source (registry/git/private)
- **UpgradeProposal**: id, affectedDependencies[], targetVersions[], riskLevel, branch/PR reference, status (pending/failed/success)
- **UpgradeReport**: generatedAt, summary, proposals[], testResults[], auditEntries[]

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of non-breaking (minor/patch) dependency updates result in green CI and merge within 72 hours of proposal creation.
- **SC-002**: 100% of Nuxt module upgrades have a successful staging build and smoke-tests pass before merge.
- **SC-003**: The upgrade process reduces the count of known-vulnerable dependency advisories by at least 75% within the first release cycle after rollout.
- **SC-004**: The average time from proposal creation to merge for low-risk updates is under 72 hours; for high-risk updates, manual review completes within 5 business days.

## Assumptions

- The repository uses a supported package manager (e.g., npm, pnpm, yarn) and has a lockfile that accurately represents installed versions.
- CI is available to run the project's test suite and build steps for verification.
- Private registries or credentials, if required, are managed outside this process and failures will be surfaced as blockers.

## Notes

- This specification focuses on the WHAT and WHY of keeping dependencies and Nuxt modules up-to-date. Implementation details (automation tooling, exact CI config, bot vs human workflows) are intentionally omitted and should be defined during planning.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: With a single maintainer, what gating policy should we apply for merges of high-risk or production dependency upgrades? → A: D — Require 1 maintainer approval + extended CI (integration tests) + mandatory staging smoke-test pass before merge.
