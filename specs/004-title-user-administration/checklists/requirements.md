# Specification Quality Checklist: User Administration - Manage Appwrite Users

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (non-normative notes only)

## Validation Notes

All checklist items were reviewed on 2025-10-24.

- No implementation-specific SDK or code-level details remain in the main spec; implementation notes were intentionally neutralized to reference a server-side trusted client rather than a specific SDK.

- The spec includes prioritized user stories with independent acceptance scenarios (P1â€“P3) and clearly testable functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-009).

- Success criteria are measurable (timing, coverage targets, observability coverage) and written without implementation details.

## Result

All items PASS. The specification is ready for the next phase: planning (`/speckit.plan`) or clarification if you want to change scope.
