# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.

- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

### Nuxt-Specific Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Pages MUST support [SSR/CSR/Static - specify rendering mode per route]

- **NFR-004**: Performance MUST meet [<3s FCP, <100ms API response, <500kb bundle size]
- **NFR-005**: SEO MUST include [meta tags, structured data, sitemap requirements]

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **NFR-006**: Deployment target MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: static site, serverless, Node.js server?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Test-Driven Development Requirements _(mandatory)_

Following [Constitution Core Principle IV](../memory/constitution.md#iv-test-driven-development-non-negotiable):

### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle

**Phase 1: Write Failing Tests (RED)**

- [ ] Unit tests written for all components BEFORE component implementation
- [ ] Unit tests written for all stores/composables BEFORE implementation
- [ ] API contract tests written BEFORE server route implementation
- [ ] E2E tests written for critical user journeys BEFORE feature implementation
- [ ] All tests initially FAIL (proving they test actual functionality)
- [ ] Test failure screenshots/logs documented as proof of RED phase

**Phase 2: Implement to Pass Tests (GREEN)**

- [ ] Minimum code written to make unit tests pass
- [ ] Server API routes implemented to pass contract tests
- [ ] Components implemented to pass component tests
- [ ] E2E tests pass after feature implementation
- [ ] All tests now PASS (GREEN phase achieved)

**Phase 3: Refactor (MAINTAIN GREEN)**

- [ ] Code refactored for clarity, performance, and maintainability
- [ ] All tests remain GREEN during and after refactoring
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at >80% for components and server routes

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (Vitest + Nuxt Test Utils):

- [ ] Component rendering and props
- [ ] Component events and user interactions
- [ ] Composable return values and reactivity
- [ ] Store state, actions, and getters
- [ ] Server utility functions

**API Contract Tests** (Vitest):

- [ ] Request/response structure validation
- [ ] HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Authentication/authorization

**E2E Tests** (Playwright):

- [ ] Critical user journeys from spec
- [ ] Cross-page navigation flows
- [ ] Form submissions and validations
- [ ] Error state handling

### Standards Compliance Requirements

**Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 AA):

- [ ] Semantic HTML elements used (nav, main, article, etc.)
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] ARIA labels provided for icon-only buttons
- [ ] Focus states visible and properly managed
- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets 4.5:1 ratio

**Component Communication**:

- [ ] Props/events pattern for parent-child communication
- [ ] Pinia store (via composable) for cross-component shared state
- [ ] Composables for feature-specific reusable logic
- [ ] Event names use kebab-case
- [ ] Maximum 10 props per component

**Error Handling**:

- [ ] All async operations wrapped in try-catch
- [ ] Loading, error, and success states for all data fetches
- [ ] User-friendly error messages with retry options
- [ ] Server errors logged but not exposed to client
- [ ] Error boundaries implemented for major sections

**CSS & Styling**:

- [ ] Tailwind utility classes used exclusively
- [ ] Custom CSS justified and documented if used
- [ ] Responsive design at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
- [ ] Dark mode support via `dark:` variants
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive approach

**Documentation**:

- [ ] All components have JSDoc comments with @example
- [ ] All composables documented with usage examples
- [ ] All API routes documented with params, returns, throws
- [ ] README updated with new features and API endpoints
- [ ] Environment variables documented

**Naming Conventions**:

- [ ] Components: PascalCase.vue
- [ ] Composables: camelCase.ts with `use` prefix
- [ ] Stores: camelCase.ts
- [ ] Pages: kebab-case.vue or [...].vue
- [ ] API Routes: kebab-case.[method].ts
