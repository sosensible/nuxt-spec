# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Nuxt 4.x with Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript strict mode
**Primary Dependencies**: @nuxt/ui, @nuxt/image, @nuxt/scripts, Nuxt Test Utils, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., Supabase, PlanetScale, file-based, or N/A]  
**Testing**: Nuxt Test Utils, Vitest for components/server, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Universal - static sites, serverless functions, Node.js servers
**Project Type**: Nuxt full-stack application with server API routes
**Performance Goals**: <3s FCP, <100ms API responses, <500kb initial bundle, >90 Lighthouse scores
**Constraints**: SSR/CSR compatibility, deployment target versatility, type safety across boundaries
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 100 pages, 50 components or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [ ] **Modular Component Architecture**: Feature components are composable, reusable, and follow Vue 3 Composition API
- [ ] **Universal Rendering**: Pages support SSR/client rendering with explicit route rules
- [ ] **API-First Development**: Server API routes defined with contracts before implementation
- [ ] **Component-Driven Testing**: Test strategy covers components, server routes, and E2E journeys
- [ ] **Deployment Versatility**: Solution works across static, serverless, and Node.js deployment targets
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: <3s FCP, <100ms API responses, <500kb initial bundle targets defined
- [ ] **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode with client-server boundary type safety

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
