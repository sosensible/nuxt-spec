# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Nuxt 4.x with Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript strict mode
**Primary Dependencies**: @nuxt/ui, @nuxt/image, @nuxt/scripts, Nuxt Test Utils, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., Supabase, PlanetScale, file-based, or N/A]  
**Testing**: Nuxt Test Utils, Vitest for components/server, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Universal - static sites, serverless functions, Node.js servers
**Project Type**: Nuxt full-stack application with server API routes
**Performance Goals**: <3s FCP, <100ms API responses, <500kb initial bundle, >90 Lighthouse scores
**Constraints**: SSR/CSR compatibility, deployment target versatility, type safety across boundaries
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 100 pages, 50 components or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [ ] **Modular Component Architecture**: Feature components are composable, reusable, and follow Vue 3 Composition API
- [ ] **Universal Rendering**: Pages support SSR/client rendering with explicit route rules
- [ ] **API-First Development**: Server API routes defined with contracts before implementation
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle will be followed (tests written BEFORE implementation)
- [ ] **Deployment Versatility**: Solution works across static, serverless, and Node.js deployment targets
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: <3s FCP, <100ms API responses, <500kb initial bundle targets defined
- [ ] **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode with client-server boundary type safety

## Standards Compliance Checklist

_Reference: [Development Standards](../memory/development-standards.md)_

### State Management

- [ ] State management pattern identified (Pinia store via composable / composable only / props & events)
- [ ] Store access pattern follows composable wrapper requirement (no direct store imports in components)
- [ ] Justification documented if complexity exceeds component-local state

### Component Design

- [ ] Component communication pattern defined (props/events vs composable vs store)
- [ ] Component complexity within limits (max 300 lines, max 10 props, max 5 events)
- [ ] Naming conventions specified (PascalCase components, camelCase composables with `use` prefix)

### Accessibility & UX

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements identified
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure planned
- [ ] Keyboard navigation requirements defined
- [ ] Screen reader support requirements specified

### Error Handling

- [ ] Client-side error handling strategy defined (loading/error/success states)
- [ ] Server-side error handling strategy defined (validation, authorization, error codes)
- [ ] Error boundaries identified for major sections

### Documentation

- [ ] Component documentation requirements identified (JSDoc with examples)
- [ ] API route documentation requirements identified
- [ ] README updates planned for new features

### CSS & Styling

- [ ] Tailwind-first approach confirmed
- [ ] Custom CSS justified if needed (animations, global utilities, third-party overrides)
- [ ] Responsive design requirements defined (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Dark mode support confirmed

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
