## CI/CD Integration

Update GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run validation tests
        run: npx playwright test -g "validation" --workers=1

      - name: Upload test results
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

- [ ] Review test coverage metrics
- [ ] Update documentation

### Quarterly

- [ ] Comprehensive testing pattern review
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add new patterns as needed

## Resources

- **Reference Repo**: [nuxt-spec](https://github.com/sosensible/nuxt-spec)
- **Standard Docs**: `tests/SPECKIT-VALIDATION-STANDARD.md`
- **Quick Start**: `tests/QUICK-START.md`
- **Discussions**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sosensible/speckit/discussions)

---

## Notes

- Use `--workers=1` for initial implementation to avoid hydration issues
- Test data must use "invalidemail" (no @) for email validation
- All forms need 3-second hydration buffer
- Document any repo-specific patterns
